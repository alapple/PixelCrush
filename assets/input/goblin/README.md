the goblins wont attack the player instead they will steal from the player, they will bring the stolen ressources back to their camp.
The player has the chance to get his ressources back by fighting the camp or enter the next wave without attacking the camp, but losing the ressources.

If a goblin king hit comes near the player he wont attack him but sniff for ressources, if the player has a lot of ressources the goblins will go into "gold rush" which just means that 5-10 more goblins will spawn and the goblins will gain a speed boost, now they will try to take the ressources of the player, if they dont succeed within a certain time limit or until the player has killed the wave, they will despawn taking the stolen ressources with them never to be seen again.

If a player kills a normal goblin nothing will happen, the goblin will drop the ressources he stole, if he did steal any, however
if the player kills the king, the goblins will become hostile.
